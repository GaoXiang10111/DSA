# Contributing to DSA

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

All contributors must agree to the CLA before their code can be merged. You can do this in one of two ways:

### 1. PR Checkbox (Preferred)
- Add the following to your pull request description:

  - [x] I agree to the Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

  (You may also use: "CLA: yes", "I accept the CLA", or similar acceptance phrases.)

### 2. Commit Sign-off
- Add a `Signed-off-by` line to each commit message. Example:

      Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>

You can add this automatically with:

    git commit -s -m "Your commit message"

## Development Workflow

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or fix.
3. Run `make all` and `pytest -q` to ensure all tests pass.
4. Open a pull request and check the CLA box in the PR description.
5. Wait for CI to pass and for review.

## Code Style
- Follow existing code conventions.
- Write clear commit messages.
- Add or update tests as needed.
